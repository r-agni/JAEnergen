The program calculates the required storage capacity when averaging the load over different time periods. It does this by starting with an initial storage capacity of 0.1 GWh. It is assumed that the supply is constant at the average over a specific time period (e.g. When averaging over 24 hours, it is assumed that the supply for each day is at the average demand of that day). At each 15-minute interval, the excess (difference between the demand and average) is added to the storage. If the supply is more than the demand, the excess is positive, and if the supply is less than the demand, the excess is negative. When the storage has reached the maximum capacity, the supply is ramped down to exactly match the demand. If, at any point, the amount of energy in storage is less than the deficit, it means that the storage capacity is not large enough, so it is increased by a factor of 1.1. This process is repeated until it reaches a storage capacity which is large enough to supply the required energy whenever there is a deficit. Since the storage is increased by a factor of 1.1, the final storage capacity is within 10% of the exact value.
